Today marks my 1 month anniversary of living full time in a [Roadtrek](http://www.roadtrek.com/) Class B RV (1998 Roadtrek 190 Popular). I live with all my worldly possessions in about 140 square feet and it's *amazing*!

> I've never felt so free!

Things are definitely different living on the road and in such a small place. But there's a calming feeling waking up and looking down the aisle of my van to see my kitchen, bathroom, wardrobe, & vehicle all contained in one small space. I guess you can say I'm part of the "[tiny house movement](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/tiny-house-movement/)", but my tiny house happens to be a van. I have no rent, no electricity or water bill, no mortgage payment, and because I bought the van with cashâ€“no car payment!

So what have I been doing with this newfound freedom? Visiting family, hitting up dropzones, and [boondocking](http://freecampsites.net/what-is-boondocking/) on public land & national parks. I can usually find electricity at an airport while I'm skydiving so I can run the A/C and microwave without having to run my generator. Now that it's getting a little cooler, I barely run the generator at all when I'm off the grid and solely rely on the battery for electricity (driving or running the generator recharges the batteries).

I've had a great time visiting a bunch of dropzones so far... [Skydive East Tennessee](http://skydiveet.com/), [Adventure Skydiving Tennessee](http://www.astskydiving.com/), [Skydive Alabama](http://www.skydivealabama.com/), [Gold Coast Skydivers](http://www.goldcoastskydivers.com/), and an unfortunate weathered out weekend at [Skydive Dallas](http://www.skydivedallas.com/). I'm excited that I hit ==100 jumps== a few weekends ago! I basically pick the next dropzone and then plan my travel time and stops during the week based on  arriving at the DZ on Friday and leaving on Sunday.

Currently I'm boondocking and working at the [Lake Meredith National Recreation Area](http://www.nps.gov/lamr/index.htm) just north of Amarillo, TX. I'll spend a few days here before I move on to my next destination... wherever that might be...
