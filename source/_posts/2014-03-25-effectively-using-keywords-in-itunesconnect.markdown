Make sure you’re using the keywords field in iTunes Connect to its fullest. Think about words, brands, companies, and yes… other apps… that your potential customers would be searching for. Think like an App Store user and not a developer. Although these keywords are never seen by end-users, they are a big part of Apple’s search algorithm so make sure you fill up the **entire** 100 characters.

==Tip: spaces after the commas aren't needed!== Gain some valuable characters by removing all the spaces after commas so “texting, unicode, ascii, sharing, friends” becomes “texting,unicode,ascii,sharing,friends”.
