So you’ve got this _killer_ idea for an app! Thats great, but don’t start building it right away.  Before jumping head first into creating the app you should run through a few "validation steps":

1. *Validate the market* - Just because you think it’s a good idea doesn’t mean people will want to buy it. Use services like [App Annie](https://www.appannie.com/) to look at the category of app your idea fits in and see what’s popular and doing well. Check to see if there are other apps that exist in the same space, and if they do, make sure you have clear ideas about to set yours apart.
2. *Validate the idea* - Before you write a line of code, draw up some initial concepts that show the main functionality of the app. _DO NOT_ ask your friends or family for their opinion. Despite what you may think, they’re going to tell you want you want to hear. Find a disinterested 3rd party who will give you honest feedback about the idea.
3. *Validate the user interaction* - Now you can start coding. Don’t polish anything. Don’t fix bugs. Just get a working prototype of your app in the hands of a few people and see how they use it. Take notes and ask questions (but not leading ones).

Once you’ve successfully completed these steps, you can start building your production app. The app could likely to be very different from your original vision, but it’s likely to be better and a bigger success because of these few validation steps.
