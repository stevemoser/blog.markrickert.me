Are you an [iTunes Affiliate](http://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/)? If you write mac or iOS apps you _should_ be! You're losing out on an additional revenue stream if you don't use affiliate links. Once you sign up for the program and get your affiliate code, all you have to do is append `at=[your affiliate code]` to any iTunes Store or Mac App Store links and you will earn a percentage of any sales for that user's __session__ (not just on your apps or the app you linked to, up to 24 hours)!

A great feature of the affiliate program is that it can also track campaigns. In addition to the `at` query parameter, you can use `ct=whatever` to track campaigns. I always post links to Twitter with `ct=twitter` so that I know how much revenue I've earned from people clicking my links on Twitter.

Unless you run a link-heavy website that just drives traffic to the App Stores, you won't see a huge amount of revenue from the affiliate program. But if you advertise your apps on your website you might as well make some money off those links! You can earn 1-7% of the user's total transaction and on average my website generates $15-$30 a month in affiliate commissions. It's just another great way to make some extra passive income.
