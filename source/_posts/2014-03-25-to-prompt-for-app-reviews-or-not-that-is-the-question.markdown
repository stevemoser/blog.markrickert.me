There's a [huge controversy](http://www.marco.org/2013/12/14/rate-this-app) over whether or not you should prompt users to rate your app after a certain number of uses or a predetermined user action.

I use [Appirater](https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater) and have experimented with releasing builds with and without it enabled. In my experience, I get _zero_ reviews/ratings in my apps when I don't specifically ask the user to do it. It’s unfortunate that users need a personal invitation to give feedback about an app, but in my experience it’s the only way to actually get reviews and ratings. Most users will just dismiss the dialog and move on, but those critical few who actually take the time to rate your app will make all the difference.

Ultimately, you need to decide where you fall on this issue and take what you think is the best course of action for your particular situation.
