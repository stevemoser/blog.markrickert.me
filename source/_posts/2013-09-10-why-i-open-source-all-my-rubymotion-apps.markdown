title: Why I Open Source ALL My RubyMotion Apps

I discovered [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) about a year ago. I had been writing some very successful iOS apps in niche markets for a little over 2 years. So I know the frameworks, open source libraries, and Apple APIs pretty well. I wouldn't say I'm a fantastic iOS developer, but at least "pretty good." My company turns a profit and my users are happy - that in and of itself is a monumental task.

So I started playing around with RubyMotion and realized that this was a viable toolchain to help me write code faster, better, and more expressively. RubyMotion also makes maintenance of your iOS app a lot more palatable, in my opinion (I have one app that hasn't been updated in 1.5 years because the Objective-C project is all spaghetti-code).

A while ago I decided to open source [*all* of the RubyMotion applications I write](https://github.com/MohawkApps/) or port over from Objective-C for a few simple reasons:

1. **The RubyMotion community is young and vibrant.** Being young means that there aren't a whole lot of examples available apart from the official documentation, some online tutorials, and [a book](http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion) written recently. I want to put out full and working applications for those developers to look at, compile, and learn from. I hang out in the RubyMotion IRC chat room all the time and I can't tell you the number of times someone has asked a question and I just send a link to how I solved the exact same problem in one of my apps.
2. **The barrier to entry for my customer base is extremely high.** My customers aren't going to pay $99 to Apple for a developer license and then $200 to HipByte for RubyMotion just so they can compile my $4 app. The barrier to entry is simply too high for my target market, both financially and technologically.
3. **I want to.** Plain and simple. I love open source software and I want to give back. I've made a living using OSS for the past 10+ years and this is my way to say thank you (as well as being a [core contributor](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/graphs/contributors) to the best RubyMotion gem out there - [ProMotion](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion)). Open source software makes you a better programmer by providing an open forum where anyone can look at and critique your code. It creates a sense of accountability and therefore you put forth your best effort since you know the code is going to be public.

Why do you open source your work? Hit me up on twitter and let's talk.
