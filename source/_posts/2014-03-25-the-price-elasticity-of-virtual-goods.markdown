How did you decide on the price of your paid app? A good way to figure out a general price range is to show someone (_not_ friends or family) your app and ask "how much would you pay for this?" Once you get a general price point start playing with the price in iTunes Connect to find the "sweet spot".

The demand curve for your app changes as the price changes in an effect called [price elasticity of demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand). Demand will go down as your price goes up. How much demand changes depends on a number of factors including similar app availability (and price) and how necessary the app is to a user. Since the supply of digital goods is technically unlimited, the only thing we can do to measure change in demand is simply change the price.

Once you've played with the price of your app a bit, you'll be able to find that sweet spot of income per download vs. demand of the app to reach the maximum downloads at the highest price. This is where you should keep the price of your app. Remember: not all apps need to be _or should be_ $0.99.
