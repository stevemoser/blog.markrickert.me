I've been wearing a [Nike+ FuelBand](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband) since March, 2013. I really loved it and it helped motivate me to hit my daily movement goal since sitting at a computer all day tends to wreak havoc on your fitness.

There's really one main reason I'm giving up the FuelBand: it goes crazy when I'm riding my motorcycle. It'll log hundreds of "[Fuel Points](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/what_is_fuel/)" in just a 20 minute ride, causing my actual fitness and activity level reporting to be *way* off. Then there's the whole issue of Nike's proprietary Fuel system. I have no clue how many calories a Fuel Point is. I'd rather just have it track calories as a primary unit of measurement, but you can't turn off the Fuel display on the band.

When I got my Fitbit FLEX in the mail I wore both devices to compare the the reporting and accuracy of each. I really like the flexibility of the FLEX's band and it makes it a lot more comfortable to sleep with it on. I haven't been sleeping with my FuelBand for the past month or so since it was uncomfortable to wear to bed, but now that I've been logging all my sleep with the FitBit and it's awesome.

I lost 0 lbs with the Nike FuelBand in about 4 months.  
I've lost 10 lbs over the last month with the FitBit.

I think that speaks for itself. I'll be sticking with the FitBit and recommending it to friends over the FuelBand.
